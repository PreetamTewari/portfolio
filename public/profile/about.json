    "about": " I am Preetam and I have been working in the software industry for the last 6 years. I have extensive experience in developing and maintaining software applications.\n\n\n\nIn my previous role at Juniper Networks, I was responsible for developing multiple large scale applications. My tech stack with mostly included VueJS for the frontend, laravel/NodeJS for backend and I have used Python extensively for automating and scripting tasks. One of the major project that I worked on was developing a Web based testing framework for the products at Juniper Networks. It included a UI tool to drag and drop nodes to create a network topology and creating custom testcases and submitting the run. In the backend, I have handled the initialization of VMs for each of the node, loading the configs and image and then running the testcases.",
